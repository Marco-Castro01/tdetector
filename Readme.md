TDetector is a Python library for detecting vehicles, recognizing license plates, and identifying traffic infractions in images and videos. This library uses deep learning models like YOLO for object detection and Tesseract OCR for text recognition on license plates.

## Features

- **Vehicle Detection:** Uses the YOLO model to detect vehicles in images and videos.
- **License Plate Recognition:** Uses Tesseract OCR to recognize text on vehicle license plates.
- **Infraction Identification:** Identifies traffic infractions based on the position and behavior of vehicles.
